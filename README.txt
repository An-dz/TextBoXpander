TextBoXpander is a simple extension for Opera.

What does it do?

TextBoXpander automatically enlarges textareas and input fields while you're typing so you can always read your whole text without having to resize them manually.

Thanks a lot to André for naming the extension and Lauren for designing the icon :)
